--------------------------------------------
What day is the Applied AI after school program?

The Applied AI after school program runs every Thursday during the school term.


--------------------------------------------
What times does the program run?
--------------------------------------------
The program is split into two age-appropriate groups:

• Grade 4–5: 14:40 – 15:40  
• Grade 6–7–8: 15:40 – 16:40  

Each session is one hour long and designed to be engaging, interactive, and hands-on.

What will the students learn?
--------------------------------------------
Students will gain a practical and age-appropriate introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

They will learn:
- What AI is and how it works in the real world  
- How AI systems are built, trained, tested, and improved over time  
- How to design and build simple AI models and chatbots  
- How AI is used in everyday technology, games, and apps  
- The importance of using AI safely, ethically, and responsibly  

All learning is hands-on and project-based, allowing students to actively create, experiment, and problem-solve rather than just watch or listen.

Spaces are limited to ensure high-quality learning and individual support:

• 15 places for the Primary group (Grade 4–5)  
• 15 places for the Secondary group (Grade 6–7–8)
