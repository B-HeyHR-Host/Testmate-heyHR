📄 File 1 — 01_submit_expense_claim.txt

Question: How do I submit an expense claim in the finance system?

To submit an expense claim, log into the finance system and navigate to Expenses > Create New Claim.

Start by selecting the correct expense category such as travel, meals, accommodation, mileage, or home office equipment. Enter the transaction date, amount, and currency exactly as shown on the receipt. Upload a clear image or PDF of the receipt; the receipt must show the supplier name, date, and total amount.

Before submitting, ensure the expense complies with the company Expenses Policy, including daily limits, approved travel classes, and allowable expense types. Expenses outside policy may be rejected or sent back for clarification.

Once all required fields are completed, submit the claim for approval. You can track the progress under My Expenses > Submitted Claims. Approved expenses are reimbursed during the next scheduled payroll or payment run.


📄 File 2 — 02_raise_purchase_request.txt

Question: How do I raise a purchase request and get it approved?

To raise a purchase request, go to Procurement or Purchasing > Create Purchase Request in the finance system.

Complete all mandatory fields including item or service description, estimated cost, supplier name (if known), cost centre, and business justification. If the supplier is not yet set up, a supplier onboarding request may be required before approval.

Once submitted, the system automatically applies approval workflows based on company policy and value thresholds. Lower-value requests typically route to line managers, while higher-value purchases may require Finance or senior leadership approval.

You can track approval progress under My Requests > Pending Approvals. Once fully approved, a Purchase Order (PO) is generated and sent to the supplier.


📄 File 3 — 03_check_invoice_status.txt

Question: How do I check if my invoice has been paid?

Navigate to Accounts Payable > Invoices > Invoice Search. You can search using the invoice number, supplier name, PO number, or invoice date.

The invoice status will show one of the following:

Pending Approval

Approved

Scheduled for Payment

Paid

If the invoice is marked as Paid, the payment date and reference number will be visible. Payments are processed according to agreed supplier payment terms, such as 30 days from invoice date.

If an invoice is on hold, the system may display a reason such as missing information, PO mismatch, or approval delay.


📄 File 4 — 04_create_journal_entry.txt

Question: How do I create or post a journal entry?

To create a journal entry, go to General Ledger > Journals > Create Journal.

Select the appropriate journal type and posting period, then enter debit and credit lines with the correct GL accounts, cost centres, and descriptions. Journals must always balance before submission.

Once completed, submit the journal. Depending on finance controls, the journal may post automatically or require approval. Approved journals are posted to the general ledger and can be viewed under Journal History.

If an error is identified after posting, a reversal or correcting journal must be raised in line with audit requirements.


📄 File 5 — 05_view_payslip.txt

Question: Where do I find my payslip and payroll details?

Log into the system and navigate to Payroll > My Payslips. Select the relevant pay period to view your payslip.

Your payslip shows gross pay, deductions such as tax, national insurance, pension contributions, and your net pay. It may also include overtime, bonuses, or expense reimbursements.

If your net pay has changed compared to previous months, this may be due to tax code changes, benefit deductions, unpaid leave, or variable earnings.


📄 File 6 — 06_expenses_policy.txt

Question: What is the expenses policy and what can I claim?

The company Expenses Policy is available under Finance Policies > Expenses.

Employees may claim reasonable business-related expenses such as travel, accommodation, meals within daily limits, mileage, and approved equipment. Receipts are required for all claims unless otherwise stated.

Non-allowable expenses include personal purchases, fines, penalties, and unapproved upgrades. Expenses submitted outside policy limits may be rejected or require additional justification.


📄 File 7 — 07_supplier_setup.txt

Question: How do I set up a new supplier in the system?

To set up a new supplier, navigate to Procurement > Supplier Management > New Supplier Request.

Complete the supplier form with legal entity name, address, bank details, tax information, and upload required compliance documents. The request will be reviewed by Procurement and Finance teams.

Once approved, the supplier becomes available for use in purchase requests and invoices.


📄 File 8 — 08_budget_check.txt

Question: How do I check my department’s budget and remaining spend?

Go to Reports > Budget vs Actuals and select your cost centre and reporting period.

The report displays allocated budget, actual spend, committed spend, and remaining balance. If spending approaches or exceeds budget limits, additional approval may be required.

This report helps managers track spending and forecast future costs.


📄 File 9 — 09_approval_limits.txt

Question: What are the approval limits and who approves finance requests?

Approval limits are defined in the Delegation of Authority Policy, available under Finance Policies.

Approval levels depend on transaction value, cost centre, and request type. Line managers approve lower-value items, while higher-value purchases route to senior management or Finance leadership.

The system automatically applies these rules during submission.


📄 File 10 — 10_correct_transaction.txt

Question: How do I correct a finance transaction or expense submitted incorrectly?

If the transaction is still pending approval, you can edit or withdraw it from My Requests.

If already approved or posted, submit a correction or reversal request through Finance. Supporting documentation may be required to meet audit and compliance standards.

Corrections must follow internal controls to ensure accurate financial reporting.
