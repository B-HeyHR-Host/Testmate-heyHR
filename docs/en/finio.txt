Expense Claims – Finance System

To submit an expense claim, log into the finance system and navigate to Expenses > Create New Claim.

Select the appropriate expense category, enter the transaction date and amount, and upload a valid receipt.

Once submitted, the expense claim is routed for approval. After approval, reimbursement is processed in the next scheduled payroll or payment run.

You can track the status of your expense claim under My Expenses > Submitted Claims.
