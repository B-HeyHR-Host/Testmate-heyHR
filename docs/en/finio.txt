1. How do I submit an expense claim in the finance system?

To submit an expense claim, log into the finance system and navigate to Expenses > Create New Claim.

Select the appropriate expense category (for example: Travel, Meals, Accommodation, Mileage, or Home Office Equipment). Enter the transaction date, amount, and currency, ensuring these match the receipt.

Upload a clear and valid receipt showing the supplier name, date, and total amount. Review the claim to ensure it complies with the company Expenses Policy, including spending limits and allowable items.

Once complete, submit the expense claim for approval. You can track the status of your claim by going to My Expenses > Submitted Claims. Approved claims are reimbursed in the next scheduled payroll or payment run.


2. How do I check if my expense claim has been approved or paid?

To check the status of an expense claim, go to Expenses > My Expenses > Submitted Claims.

Each claim will show a status such as Pending Approval, Approved, Rejected, or Paid. If the claim is approved, it will be queued for reimbursement. If rejected, a comment explaining the reason will usually be provided.

Once the status shows Paid, the reimbursement has been processed and will appear in your next payroll or payment run.


3. How do I raise a purchase request in the finance system?

To raise a purchase request, navigate to Procurement or Purchasing > Create Purchase Request.

Enter the required details, including the item or service description, estimated cost, supplier name (if known), cost centre, and business justification. Attach any supporting documentation if required.

Submit the request and it will be routed automatically through the approval workflow based on company approval limits. You can track progress under My Requests > Pending Approvals. Once approved, a Purchase Order (PO) will be generated.


4. How do I check whether an invoice has been paid?

Go to Accounts Payable > Invoices > Invoice Search.

Search using the invoice number, supplier name, or PO number. The invoice status will indicate whether it is Pending, Approved, Scheduled for Payment, or Paid.

If the invoice is marked as Paid, the payment date and reference number will be displayed. Invoices are paid according to agreed supplier payment terms, such as 30 days from the invoice date.


5. How do I submit or post a journal entry?

To create a journal entry, navigate to General Ledger > Journals > Create Journal.

Select the appropriate journal type and posting period, then enter the debit and credit lines with the correct GL accounts, cost centres, and descriptions. Journals must always balance before submission.

Once submitted, the journal may post automatically or require approval depending on finance controls. Approved journals are posted to the general ledger and can be viewed in Journal History.


6. How do I view my payslip and payroll details?

To view your payslip, go to Payroll > My Payslips and select the relevant pay period.

Your payslip provides a breakdown of gross pay, tax deductions, pension contributions, and net pay. It may also include bonuses, overtime, or expense reimbursements.

If there are changes compared to previous months, they may be due to tax updates, benefit deductions, unpaid leave, or variable earnings.


7. What expenses am I allowed to claim under the expenses policy?

The company Expenses Policy is available under Finance Policies > Expenses.

You may claim reasonable business-related expenses such as approved travel, accommodation, meals within daily limits, mileage, and authorised equipment. Receipts are required for all claims unless stated otherwise.

Expenses that are personal, outside policy limits, or not supported by receipts may be rejected or require additional approval.


8. How do I set up a new supplier in the system?

To request a new supplier setup, go to Procurement > Supplier Management > New Supplier Request.

Complete the supplier request form with the supplier’s legal name, address, bank details, and tax information. Upload any required compliance or verification documents.

The request will be reviewed by Procurement and Finance teams. Once approved, the supplier will be available for purchase requests and invoice processing.


9. How do I check my department’s budget and remaining spend?

Navigate to Reports > Budget vs Actuals.

Select your cost centre and reporting period to view allocated budget, actual spend, committed spend, and remaining balance. This report helps monitor spending against budget and identify potential overspend risks.

If spending exceeds defined thresholds, additional approvals may be required for future requests.


10. How do I correct a finance transaction or expense submitted incorrectly?

If the transaction or expense is still Pending Approval, you can edit or withdraw it from My Requests or My Expenses.

If the item has already been approved or posted, you must contact the Finance team to request a correction or reversal. Supporting documentation may be required to comply with audit and control requirements.

Corrections are processed according to internal finance controls to ensure accurate financial reporting.
